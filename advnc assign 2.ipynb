    "The operator overloading in Python means provide extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. Such as, we use the \"+\" operator for adding two integers as well as joining two strings or merging two lists. We can achieve this as the \"+\" operator is overloaded by the \"int\" class and \"str\" class. The user can notice that the same inbuilt operator or function is showing different behaviour for objects of different classes. This process is known as operator overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the user has two objects which are the physical representation of a user-defined data type class. The user has to add two objects using the \"+\" operator, and it gives an error. This is because the compiler does not know how to add two objects. So, the user has to define the function for using the operator, and that process is known as \"operator overloading\". The user can overload all the existing operators but they cannot create any new operator. Python provides some special functions, or we can say magic functions for performing operator overloading, which is automatically invoked when it is associated with that operator. Such as, when the user uses the \"+\" operator, the magic function __ add __ will automatically invoke in the command where the \"+\" operator will be defined.\n",
